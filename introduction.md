# Introduction

This work aims to extract a groove, inteded as a stream of impulses, from an audio signal. For some kind of features that are mostly associated with notation like pitch and transients this is a well studied problem, but for more timbral features this is not the case. The purpose of this work is to extract a groove from an audio signal with a system that is sensitve to timbral features.
The intended final use of this system is to be used in a live performance setting, where the system can be used as an encoder form audio to groove in real time.
