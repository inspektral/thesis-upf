# Müller (2015) - Fundamentals of Music Processing

## Summary

Good introductory book on music processing. It covers a wide range of topics, from audio processing to music information retrieval. It is a good starting point for anyone interested in music processing. For our purposes, chapter 6 covers various traditional DSP techniques for onset detection.

## What's good

- Energy based onset detection
- Spectral based onset detection
- Phase based onset detection
- Complex domain onset detection

## What is bad

- The book is a bit outdated, but the basics are still relevant.
- AI techniques are not covered and probably perform better than traditional DSP techniques
