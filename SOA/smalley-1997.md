# Smalley(1997) - Spectromorphology: explaining sound-shapes

## Summary

The paper is a staple of electroacustic music theory and provides a framework valid for composition and analysis, it goes quite in depth, probably unneccessary for the purpose of this work. The main idea is that sound can be described in terms of its spectro-morphological characteristics. It revolves around the ideas of texture, gesture and structure. For our onset detection purposes the most useful idea is the one of gestures, which is free from the idea of pitch and rhythm, and is much more general which is what we are looking for with our timbral onset detection.

## What's good

- provides a framework for describing sound in terms of its spectro-morphological characteristics
- the idea of gestures is very general and free from the idea of pitch and rhythm

## What's bad

- tons of theory, not very practical
- unnecessary details and categories that sound a bit arbitrary, biased and not generalizable
