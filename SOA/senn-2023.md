# Senn (2023) - A Predictive Coding Approach to Modelling the Perceived Complexity of Popular Music Drum Patterns

The article proposes a model that predicts the complexity of grooves, and it strongly correlates with data from previous experiments.

## What's good

- Working mathematical model
- from data (notated patterns) probability matrices are calculated for the beats
- A complexity/effort value is calculated for a specific pattern
- all in all easy

## What's bad

- they just work on 200 4 bars long patterns
- only drums(kick snare cymbals) are considerated, in a on/off fashion

## Final thoughts

Nice idea, maybe could be a parameter for encoding or decoding, but the dimensionality of the model both input and output is very limited.
